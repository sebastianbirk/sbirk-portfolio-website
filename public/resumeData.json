    "bio":"My initial educational background is in statistics and finance (which I specialized in during my B.Sc. in International Business Administration at University of Tübingen). I have always loved to solve problems with quantitative methods but after completing my first internships for Microsoft and Amazon, I learned about machine learning and it was clear to me that this would play a big role in my professional dedication. I first started to become a Pythonista in my leisure time and completed numerous MOOCs related to data science and machine learning before completing my M.Sc. in Business Analytics at ESADE Business School in Barcelona. Afterwards I began my full-time professional career as Data Scientist at Avanade, which is a joint venture between Microsoft and Accenture. At Avanade I have built various solutions ranging from supply chain simulations to natural language processing and computer vision applications. I am always eager to learn about breakthroughs and state-of-the-art methods in machine learning in general and reinforcement learning in particular. I enjoy to read Medium blogs, listen to data-related podcasts and am a big fan of TowardsDataScience.",
