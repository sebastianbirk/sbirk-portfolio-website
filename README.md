# Description

This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website which was created with react. The repository is connected to heroku where a dev site is deployed to sbirk-portfolio-website.herokuapp.com. Continuous deployment is enabled. My production site is hosted on bluehost.com and FileZilla is used to transfer the files. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
