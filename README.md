# Description

This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website which was created with react and is deployed to heroku. Continuous deployment is enabled and the website is connected to my custom domain sebastianbirk.com. The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Resources

Check out these resources which I used to create this website:
- Creating React App: https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template
- Deployment to Heroku: https://medium.com/jeremy-gottfrieds-tech-blog/tutorial-how-to-deploy-a-production-react-app-to-heroku-c4831dfcfa08

# Hints

For local debugging use `yarn build` and `yarn start`. This will run the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to view it in the browser.
